Welcome to my Malware Database! in this repository, I provide Malware samples for educational and research purposes, So Good Luck!

WARNING: I'm not responsible for any damage done, I strongly recommend you to neither open these files on real hardware, nor misuse the malware to prank your friends. Playing with these samples may lead to irreversible consequences which may affect anything from personal data to passwords and banking information, etc. So it's only Recommended THAT you run these samples on a Virtual Machine, Just because it's safe to do so and Your host can't be affected.

If you want to extract these archives to be able to run the samples, NEVER DO IT on your main machine, IT'S NOT RECOMMENDED AND YOU WILL GET INTO TROUBLE, But you have to install alternate compression or extraction software like 7-zip or WinRAR in order to extract them! So in order to do that, Right click on the encrypted archive and select Extract files or whatever Extraction metheod you want to choose, Than type in the password, Wait for it to extract and than double click on the folder to run the sample you want!
